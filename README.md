# WorkshopSample
This project is a rough template for developing a mod for Sentinels of the Multiverse.

Visit our [website](https://sentinelsdigital.com/workshop) and the official [Engine Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRvUNq-KAWwLdvQmhjpFp-dC6s7ZJqogQJFIFfCZrhJ6_kuS9yi5KG-OmEU3g2NqsB0zkMS0KPtTC5V/pub) to learn how to adapt this project for your mod, or to get started from scratch.

Steam Workshop support in the game is now publicly available. We'll be continuing to make improvements, so to see the latest information on Workshop development status, please visit the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/vYBMImbg/sotm-workshop).

The project includes the following examples:

- Hero (Migrant Coder) with variant
- Classic villain (The Baddies) with variant
- Team villain (The Hug Monster)
- Environment (Dev Stream)
- Variants:
  - Bunker (Wayward Bunker)
  - The Sentinels (The Serpentinels)
  - Sky-Scraper (Centrist Sky-Scraper)
  - Captain Thunder (Captain Thunderstruck)
  - Cricket from Cauldron mod (Noisy Cricket)
  - Baron Blade (Baron Jeremy)

It also includes systems to help with testing your own projects:

- BaseTest unit testing class 
- Console project for interactive testing

None of the content in this mod is intended to be balanced for use in-game. It is here as an example for you to look at and build from, that is all.
